	Important scripts there:
		simFit.py: simultaneously fit the result of two channels.
		simFit.C:	outdated version of the py script.
		gKKpi0/
			gKKpi0.py:	the main script that deals with Alg result, output root file with selected events. 
			gKKpi0.C:		an outdated version of the python script  
			MassProjection.C:	translate 3C-mass/5C-mass spectra
			roofit/
				fit_KKpi0.C:		roofit script to get background lineshape
				fit_KKpipi.C
				fit_wKK_shape.C
				FSRnoFSR.C:		adding up FSR/noFSR events with weight.
		gKsKpi/
			similar to scripts in gKKpi0/
