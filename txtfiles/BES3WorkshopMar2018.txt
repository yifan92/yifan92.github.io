Evidence of h_c->ee eta_c
		by Yang Shuangli
	


MUC Efficiency Check
		by Tang Guangyi
	after high-purity di-muon selection, some events have MUC_Depth=-9.9 and there is a discrepancy between MC and data.
	
	feature of the events:
		-t0 large
		-dedx of these t0-large events is slightly smaller
		-the number of the events relates to machine status
	
	conclusion: pending experts' checks


Angular Distribution of Psi(2S)->OmegaOmega
		by Song Jiaojiao
	

Measurement of sigma(ee->KsiKsi) above open charm threshold
		-by Wang Xiongfei
	Data Sets: all XYZ data; BOSS version 703
	Event Selection:
		good tracks;
		PID
		Lambda reconstruction
		Ksi reconstruction: using SVTX recon
		further:
			mass window (ppi), (piLambda)
			decay length Ksi/Lambda
	plots:
		M(piLambda) vs. M recoil
	background study:
		just sideband
	detection efficiency:
		iterating to get ISR correction
	result:
		confirmation of Ksi(1820)
	Systematic Uncertainty:	
		-ISR factor: the difference for second/third iteration
		-total: 12.2%

	ee->Lambda_c Lambda_cbar
	charmed Baryonium?	Y(4660)
	Other FSI interpretation at threshold
	Coulomb at threshold


Search for ee->X(3872)
		by Leonard Koch
	
Study of ee-> gamma Omega Jpsi at BES3
		by Liu Zhiqing
	Data Sets: round 11 4190-4280; in BOSS703
	MC: PHSP; ISR by KKMC, FSR by PHOTOS; Background MC; 10x Inclusive MC
	Event Selection:
		good tracks and good photons; 
		PID from p and EMC deposition;
		5c kinematic fit:	chisq<100
		
	Background study:
		pipiPsi(2S), pi0pi0Psi(2S):	veto mass window of pipiJpsi and M_recoil(pipi)
		eta'Jpsi:	two dimensional cut on M(omega Jpsi) and M(gamma Omega)
		veto M(ll)
	
	Look at spectrum of M(pi+pi-pi0):	sideband
	...
	summary:
		-5 sigma 
		-the relative ratio of (3872)->omegaJpsi/(3872)->pipiJpsi = 1.7
	potential problem:
		-compromised significance if alternative background

Day 1 Session 1

Status of Software and Data Production
		by Sun Shengsen
	Data Reconstructed:
		-jpsi: 2009, 2012(not completed), 2018 ( 2nd reconstruction this Sep)
		-4180 data: round 09
	MDC Data Performance:
		-calibrating new data
		-Hitmap and New Dead Channels: 
			4 new dead cells
		-spatial and momentum resolution: 
			127 um, good alignment, sigma(p)=10.1MeV@1.548GeV
			worse than data of last round, due to lower signal amplitude
		-Gain and Resolution of dE/dx:	stable
	TOF performance:
		-Time Resolution of Barrel TOF: 
			single end 137ps, single layer 92ps, double end 70ps.
		-Efficiency of Barrel TOF: 93% for double layer;
		-Time Resolution of Endcap MRPC TOF: 55ps combined;
		-Efficiency of Endcap MRPC TOF: ~98%
	EMC performance:	
		-empty region due to crystal unglued
		-2 hot channel and 2 dead channel.	(what's hot channel?)
	Validation of BOSS 7.0.3
		-obvious efficiency improvement and better data and MC consistency at low transverse momentum region
		-the Tracking and PID efficiency correlation question put out by Song Jiaojiao in 2017.12?
	CGEM softwares
	Next Release BOSS Version
		-geant 4 update: faster, performance check
		-MRPC and cap TOF event display
		-MDC low transverse momentum track calibration, dE/dx hadron calibration and MC tuning
		
		
CGEM status:
		by G.Cibinetto on behalf of the CGEM group
	accident during CGEM construction:
		-2nd layer; 2 month delays; installation postponed to 2019


BEPC2 Performance:
		by Yu Chenghui
	-new RF cavity has been on for 3 months, good
	-aging problem -> high failure rate
	-upgrading to higher energy region
	-upgrade of parasitic operation for both BSRF and BESIII. commissioning will begin in Octomber.
