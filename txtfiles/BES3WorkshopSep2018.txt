Discussion on White Paper:
	-While a lot of work has been done, the concern has been raised by foreign colleagues that there is not enough cooperation. 
	 The bald Wolfgang commented that he feels that it's rather inappropraite to have the white paper send out of collaboration without
	 the work being circulated within the collaboration and the consensus has been reached. Things like the difference of the lengths in sections can mislead outsiders to guess about the importance
	 wrong. 
	-look to the next 5 years for data taking
	 
Light Hadron:
	-X(2370): 0-+ glueball?
	-X(1835)
	-light meson decays
