Performance Study of Tag Based Analysis
	Deng Ziyan
	tag the information like ntrack, nneutral, ... Thereby saving user the trouble of running all the data.
	Performance: ~1/5 user time

Procedures for evaluation of systematic uncertainties in BESIII
	Karin Schoenning
	Tolerance vs. systematic:	
		-tolerance: the bridge is not break
		-overestimating uncertainty make us lose discriminating power
	There is no point to collect more data when sigma_stat<sigma_sys
	Source of systematics:
		-data collection
			-time variation in detector conditions
			-trigger efficiency
			-luminosity
		-reconstruction and calibration
			-efficiency of tracking algorithm
			-track resolution
			-calibtration constants
		-analysis
			-PID
			-Kinematic fits
			-cut efficiencies
			-physics model dependence
		-parameter estimation
			-bias of method
			-QED corrections/ line shape dependence
			
	The "common practise" about SU of analysis not written down, which is a problem.
	For parameter estimation, recommended procedures needed.
	
	wish-list:
		-re-evaluation of tracking efficiencies and correlations
		-understand and correct for observed shifts in a systematic way
		-better understanding of resolution
			-include effect that contribute to data/MC mismatch
	
	
	
	

Application of Machine Learning on BESIII
	Zhang Yao
	Physics analysis with python ecosystem
		Python ecosystem like Numpy or Pandas can speed up the physics analysis
		python libraries for the HEP:
			Scikit-HEP
		
		
Partial Wave Analysis Based on Spark
	Wei Zhanchen
	PWA as a computation intensive application
	Two ways to improve computing efficiency:
		-Using GPU(Parallel)
			-performance
		-Using a Fat-mode(4-way SMP server with 120+ CPU cores and 160GB memory, parallel)
			-big memory; code reuse
	A new idea:
		use cluster to do calculation
	Spark:	
		A lightning-fast open-source unified analytics engine
		data model


Storage for BESIII:
	Li Haibo
	Lustre is working well
	Verifying a new file system: EOS


BESIII Computing Status:
	Shi Jinyan
	lxslc5 retired:
		replacement with a container(OS-level virtualization)
	lxslc7 will be the main OS for BESIII
		(scientific linux 7)


Study of Tracking Efficiency:
	Lu jiada
	The process:	
		J/psi -> pp pi pi
		tracking efficiency: n4/(n3+n4)
	Background Estimation: 
		overall background level = 2.3%
	Validation:
		comparison between singleMC and ExclusiveMC
	Problem:
		-inconsistency in different MC:
			whether J/psi decay with resonance in low Pt
		-Reliability of fitting method:
			comparison of fitting method
				-fit with gauss/MC shape
			Further checking with MC based on the PWA result is planned.
	
Status of Offline Software
	Deng Ziyan
	BOSS 7.0.4 Release:
		-Improvement of PID for MRPC end cap TOF
			-Endcap TOF upgraded in 2015
			-PID optimized in BOSSv7.0.4
			-1%~2% improvement for PID efficiency for XYZ data
		-Performance check
			-last paper on BESIII detector performance was published in 2010.
			-needs a new one.

Status of CGEM software:
	Wang Liangliang
	CgemBoss665b
	Test done:
		-Efficiency needs improvement for tracks at low pt
		-Most resolution comparable with BOSS665p01
		-Significant improvement in z spatial resolution
	global track finding with Hough Transformation
	Alignment study
	Next to do: finish full digitalization and new version of global tracking.

Procedure of Removing the MDC Inner Chamber
	Ma Xiaoyan
	Preparation for the replacement of CGEM
	study and practice on prototype
	schedule: 134 days.

BEPCII Stauts and Plan:
	by Yu Chenhui
	Operation schedule: 
		Data taking @ XYZ from 2019.1.16 to 2019.6.20
	Upgrade progress of top-up operation:
		may be ready after the summer of 2019
		upgrade to 2.3~2.45 GeV
