AI & GAN in scientific research

1980 Learning: SVM, logistic regression
2010 Deep Learning: neural network

AI-as-a-platform
start-up

a new computing model
	tranditional machine learning:
		-require domain expert
		-time consuming experimentation
		-custom algorithm
		-not scalable to new problems
	deep learning:
		-learn from data
		-easy to extend
		-can accelerate with GPU

theory behind:
	x->f(x):	f(x) is the result as a fact, x is any possible evidence.
	残差网络
		AI自动驾驶的判断图？
	RNN:循环神经网络；运用序列特征
		合成语音
	GAN:生成对抗网络
		generator-discriminator competition
		generator: think of an image as a collection of style

The introduction of RAPIDS
	CUDNN
	data science platform in python:
		-numpy: matlab copy
		-panda: data manipulation and anlysis (R语言）
		-scikit-learn: machine learning library
		-Dask: parallel processing, dynamic task scheduling
		
	the big problem in data science:
		manage data:
			ETL: extract, transform, load
		training:
			data preparation
			model training
		evaluate:
		deploy:
	
	GPU accelerated data science:
		-put data into GPU early, and till output
		python, rapids, CUDNN,CUDA,Apache Arrow
		
	
	Ecosystem:
		DB Enging: BlazingSQL, MapD
		Spark
		Pandas
		CSV file
		Apache Arrow
		
	resources:
		rapids.ai
		github.com/RAPIDSai
		Docker hub: hub.docker.com/r/rapidsai/rapidsai/rapidsai
	
	scikit-learn + XGBoost
	
	should just download the pdf; heavy on detail.

Semi-supervised learning on image finding: a case study
	task: 
		classify objects into two sets: strong lenses or not
	challenge:
		existing data sets: 20000 labeled data for ground based and sky-based telescope, respectively, the size of each image is 101*101
	
	what's supervised/unsupervised learning:
		-聚类:	untagged
		-supervised deep learning: tagged, supervised loss(x_exp - x_output).
	what's semi-supervised learning?
		-tag a small portion of data, and use (tagged+untagged) data set to get a better result.
		-a guess-tag: 前n次迭代的输出的指数平均S_n.
			-supervised loss: Y-Y' for tagged data
			-unsupervised loss: Yn- S(n-1) for untagged data
			the two data sets share the same network.
	未考虑点之间的联系：
		-对untagged data进行聚类
