	jsub-dirac:
		-minimal_dirac task:
			-work/job missing.
			-job successfully run though.
		-sim_dirac task:
			-error when creating task: files to register must be under /cefs
			-use a new stdhep filelist, with files in /cefs/		
				successfully created the task; list of files to register is right
			-can't submit the task:
				FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/junofs/users/yangyf/jsub-dirac/jsub_dirac/action/dirac_input/run'
					-fixed. 
						error cause: param.yml in action extension not rightfully parsed.
			-make the task work as intended:
				-dirac_get_file.py should use the input files.
					-how does python files use input parameters?
						
				-how to set the output 
					can get jobvar in python script with sys.argv
					can get actvar in python script with os.environ.get(key,default_value)
				-work with py instead of sh.

			-missing launcher param main_pack_file
				-didn't load launcher from jsub-dirac pack.
					-dealt with after modifying .jsubrc

				-need to download/upload data in action.
					-modified jsub_cepc app

	coding jsub dirac: 
		-try to source dirac, and run jsub:
			(venv python 3.7)
			-pip not working after source dirac:
				-venv not in $PATH
			-create and submit a task with local backend (after source dirac env):
				success in create/submit
			-create and submit a task with dirac backend:
				error: handled by python 3.7
				
			(venv with python 2.7)
			-create and submit a task with local backend (without source dirac env):
				success
			-create and submit a task with local backend (after source dirac env):
				Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>
				Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
				Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]
				ImportError: No module named site
				
			-try to python -V:
				python: error while loading shared libraries: libpython2.7.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
				-it seems that the python 2.7.15 from /cvmfs/dcomputing.ihep.ac.cn is installed wrongly?
					-has to load module python2.7.15 and common1.0 again when reentering the env.
			
			where did the error occurred:
				-after modifying LD_EXTERNAL_LIB
					-can work around by changing the order of the original $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the added content.
			
					-try to create a of dirac init script of my own.
						-doesn't solve the problem: DIRAC only works in its own python env, not in the one with jsub.

	jsub:
		-problem: jsub use the virtualenv, while dirac provide its own python.
			-not feasible to use jsub outside the virtualenv, 
			-not solvable by creating a python 2.7 virtualenv; failed
			-not possible to migrate dirac to python 3.
