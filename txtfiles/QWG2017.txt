Three perspectives on decoding charmonium-like states
		Liu Xiang
	XYZ states can be grouped into 5 categories, according to production mechanisms.
	
	Theoretical explanation:	resonant(conventional hadrons, charmonium, exotic states)/non-resonant(kinematic effect, cusp, opening of new threshold, final state interaction ...)
	
	learning from X(3872);
	
	Lambda(1405),Ds0(2317),X(3872):	common feature, couple-channel effects important;	XYZ states are correlated.
	favoring Zc(3900) to be non-resonant
	X(5568)?
